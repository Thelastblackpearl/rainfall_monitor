* The error when building WiringPi library often occurs due to missing packages or files in the Linux system. This may happen during the OS installation or if the file system wasnâ€™t updated properly during a system update.if so,
    * try reinstalling OS
    * if make is present in system (installing make)

* if there is an error like "error writing to file -write (28:no space left on device)"
    * check how much space is left on your partitions using command
        * df -h
    * check what makes the memory full.
        * It could be a service spamming the log with errors.check this usinng the command
            * sudo du -sh /var/log/*
        * if syslogs is the cause of memory fill.then remove it using the following command
            * sudo truncate -s 0 /var/log/syslog
    * then free up some space by removing unnecessary data or packages

* issue: IP V4 is not assigning to ethernet(V6 is present): https://www.freshblurbs.com/blog/2022/08/07/fix-eth0-rpi-ubuntu.html
* Add wifi credentials and ethernet details to the existing system
    * sudo vim  /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
    * Add the following content to the file (use Vim editor to make sure consistent indentation)
``` bash

    ethernets:
        eth0:

            optional: true
    version: 2
    wifis:

            optional: true
            access-points:
                "wifi_name":
                        password: "password"

 ``` 	

    * Then run ,to know if it is working
	    * sudo netplan generate
        * sudo netplan apply
